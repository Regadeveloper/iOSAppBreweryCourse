This folders are the differents modules of the course divided by content according to my perspective.
The first folders are quite easy but I'm trying to learn by acting as if I didn't know anything beforehand to avoid bad habits.
I will add Readmes to every folder to showcase what content is present on those files
Some exercises are more of a "follow along" while others are challenges made using imports from just assets. I'll try to differentiate them when I consider it needed or asked to.
